# Public Take-Home Exercise
Please create a local Git repository and commit your work as you go. Send it back to us once you are done. 

## Let's get started
For this exercise we'd like you to create a simple **to-do list** app.

It should be possible to:
- Have an overview of all tasks
- Add a new task (title and description with a 50 and 200 character limit respectively)
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task

When the user attempts to add a task, the app should simulate making a network call. Please add a random delay between 0.5 and 2.5 seconds before continuing. After the delay, the app should simulate that a network call can fail. It should have a success rate of 75%. Please add what you'd consider graceful error handling.

It's up to you to decide how you want to implement the user interface, navigation framework, state management, data storage, etc.

You're welcome to expand upon the scope of this exercise if you want to show off your skills / creativity.

Good luck & please feel free to reach out with any questions!
